The UPA Handbook iOS Application's Source Code


Background
==========
I wrote this as my very first iPhone app, back when they first started letting you develop apps for the iPhone, back in the iPhone 1 days.

This is code very ugly and needs a lot of TLC. I have only touched it once since I released 3+ years ago, and that was to fix and
issue with flurry and to upload it here. 

I know the code is bad, but it does what it needs to do, so instead of telling me how bad it is, show me, by fixing the code.

TODO
====
- The most requested feature of all time is searching. If someone can take the time and add searching to this simple app, you would make a lot of people happy.
- It would be nice to update the app so that it isn't just a sqlite database with html files, not sure how to do it, but something bettwe would be nice.
- Adding multiple language support would be cool.
- Make an iPad version
- update the graphics / images to something nicer looking
- Add unit tests
- Add better documentation
- Clean up the code
